<p>
HTML is a short for HyperText MarkUp Language.Basically, it's the "code" behind every webpage-even this one.if you'are just beginning to leran HTML.  let us tell you that it's a fairly east task.HTMl,
without styling,can't do anythingmore than setting a layout,drawing a table or creating frames-but it is handy as it helps you structure
 the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your Html

<p>
    However simple this mioght seen,it is a migthy useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development .
    Various tols easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process-but if you want to e in full control of your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.
</p>
<p>
    Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTMl building blocks that'll help you get up and running.
    reading this,you'll be able to understand an HTML source code and even Modify it for your own good!

    <h1>Step One-TAGS</h1>
    <div>
        <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTMl source cose.A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document .Tags tell what magic  is to be done on the content  enclosed by them.
        </p>
        <p>Let's look at two types of tags:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>&lttag-example-1>I need  a closing tag&lt/tag-example-1></li>
            <li>&lttag-example-2/>I don't need  a closing tag.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>
            <p>in the first example,the sentence is wrapped by two tags . the first one is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag.Everything in between is affected by the Properties of the tag.
                very commonly used examples of such trags are &lthtml&gt,&lthead&gt,&ltbody&gt,etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second example tags about loner tags-as in, they dont need a closing tag to function.Although it's not required , these types of tags are often written as &lttag/&gt
                 to make the debugging of code easier. Common examples of such tags are &lthr/&gt-used for horizontal line,&ltbr/&gt-to break the line etc;
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Step Two-HTML,HEAD,and BODY:The three pillars of your document</h2>
</diV>
<img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg"/>
<p>These tags are essential for any HTML document.They parcel out the significan parts of your HTML code.</p>
<ul>
    <li>&ltBODY> &lt\BODY> is placed below your &ltHEAD>tag, and eerything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag.text,images,links,and pretty much
        anything you can see in your browser live inside this tag
    </li>
    <li>&ltHTML> &lt/HTML> wraps your entire code.Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these tags.</li>
    <li>&ltHEAD>&lt/HEAD> includes things like title,styles and scripts. Head is usually  present at the top(hah!),just inside the&lt/HTML>tag.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h2>Step three- A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to step up the skeleton of your  document ,lets proced with the things that will go inside your &ltBody>tag and do some magic!</p>

<P>Some basic text formatting tags:
    <ul>
        <li>&ltb>&lt/b> makes your text look <b>bold</b></li>
        <li>&lti>&lt/i> makes you write in <i>cursive</i></li>
    <li>&ltu>&lt/u><u>underlines</u> what you just wrote</li>
    </ul>
    <p>for example,this piece of code
        <hr>
        &lthtml><br>
        <div>
          &lthead>&nbsp;&lt/head><br>
        </div>
        &ltbody><br>
        &lti> I am italics! &lt/i> &ltbr/><br>
        &ltb> I am bold! &lt/b> &ltbr/><br>
        &lt/body><br>
        &lthtml>
        <hr>

    </p>
    <p>Should produce something like this on your browser. Dontfret
        too much about the &ltbr/>.it's just for breaking the line
        so that you can start from the next line.Enter key does little when it comes to changing  lines in our HTML document
    </p>

<h3>Tags  to help you the structure your  content:</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>&ltbr/> breaks the line, making you continue to the next Line</li>
   <li>&ltp> stands for paragraph. it devides your content  into paragraphs</li>
    </ul>
    Note:<i>you need to use these tags as space and enter keys do vey little when it comes to formatting conetent an HTML document.</i>
</p>
<div>
    <h2>Heading Tags:</h2>
    <p>HTML provides you with six tags ,from&ltH1>&lt/H1> to &ltH6>&lt/H6> to help you create different sized  headers quickly.</p>
  <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png">

</div>
<div>
    <h3>Inserting an image:</h3>
    <p>All that's good,but  fun without images on thewebpage?Don't worry,&ltIMG/> 
        to the rescue! the image tag has a mandatory attribute called"source".
        Basically,it tells the browser where it should look for the image. the Syntax goes something like:
        <br>
        <P>
        &lt img src="<I>path_to_your_image</I>/>" </P>
        Furthermore, it also has  attributes like height and width that let you specify the 
        height and width you want your image to take.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Lists:</h3>
    <p>HTML has two ypes of lists-ordered and unordered .Each item of your list has to be enclosed in a tag. The syntax creating a list is firly simple
        
    </p>
    <p>Suppose  you want to create a list like:
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
         The following code will easily do the job for you:
         <hr>
         &ltul><br>
         &ltli> Item 1 &lt/li><br>
         &ltli> Item 2 &lt/li><br>
         &ltli> Item 3 &lt/li><br>
         &lt/ul> 
         <hr>
         This, by the way ,was an exampke of an unordered list
         .For an ordered list,all you need to do is replace &ltul> with &ltol>
         and&lt/ul> with &lt/ol>.
         <p>Let's See  what the following code does:
            <hr>
            &lthtml><br>
            &lthead> &lt/head><br>
            &ltbody> <br>
            &ltul><br>
            &ltli>  I am unordered list's item 1! &lt/li><br>
            &ltli>  I am unordered list's item 2! &lt/li><br>
            &ltli>  I am unordered list's item 3!&lt/li><br>
            &ltli>  I am unordered list's item 4!&lt/li><br>
            &lt/ul><br>
            &ltol><br>
            &ltli>  I am ordered list's item 1! &lt/li><br>
            &ltli>  I am ordered list's item 2! &lt/li><br>
            &ltli>  I am ordered list's item 3!&lt/li><br>
            &ltli>  I am ordered list's item 4!&lt/li><br>
            &lt/ol><br>
            &lt/body> <br>
            &lt/html>
         </p>
         <hr>
         <hr>
         <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001489.png">
    <p>All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide you with  a simple web pag
        consisting of images, headings, ad lists Further, there are various  tags that HTML, supports,
         and we thoroughly recommend you to check them out and play with them!
    </p>
    <h3>In COnclusion</h3>

        we request you to go a head and try skiming through the source code of any website(you'll find some tags you don't know,but that's how you learn!)and play with them!
    </p>
